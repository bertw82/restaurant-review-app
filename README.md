 Resturant Review app using jQuery

 In this app I used jQuery to create all of the functionality of the app. This is a Restaurant review app where a user can click a button to add a review. This opens a modal window where there is the option to add the restaurant name and a short review. There is also the option to give the restaurant a star rating. This information is then used to create a new review on the main page. 

 I have also created a small photo gallery with the FancyBox jQuery plugin.
